# The Farm 
I grew up on a farm near Chamois. On the Main Farm we grow corn, beans, and raise cattle. But, me  
and my brothers run a produce farm where we grow sweet corn, watermelon, cantaloupe, and pumpkins.  
The name of our farm is [Boys From Chamois](https://www.boysfromchamois.com/) every weekend we drive to the columbia farmers market and  
sell our produce to thousands of every week.
